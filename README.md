# royal-inscriptions
Topic modeling experiments for Mesopotamian royal inscriptions - cobbled together by an Assyriologist from online resources, and considerable help from Tom Lippincott. All errors are my own, and anything that works really well is courtesy of someone else!

Template comes from here: http://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-gensim-python/
Edited to change the input format

08/28/2018 updated Basic modeling + Coherence to include code to save the data frames as excel files (dominant_topic and representative_document). Also now uses input_multiple as the input file.

08/28/2018 added input_multiple.zip
